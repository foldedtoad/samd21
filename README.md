# SSD1306 OLED display on SAMD21 + ZEPHYR

This project shows how the Zephy RTOS running on an Atmel SAMD21 SOC, can control a Solomon SSD1306 OLED display.

In this specific phyical configuration, the board was the Adafruit_Feather_M0_Basic_Proto board, combined with the 
Adafruit_OLED_FeatherWing display+buttons.

While the above configuration has been successfully run, other combinations of SAMD21 and SSD1306 display work as well or be easily modified to work.

This project doesn't provide a guide for connecting a JTAG/SWD emulator to the target SAMD21 board, but left as a QED.
